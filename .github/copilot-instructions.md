RULES OF THE ROAD
1.  NO CHANGES WITHOUT EXPLICIT APPROVAL
•   I will describe what you want to do
•   You will wait for me to say "yes" or "do it"
•   You will NEVER, EVER, EVER make any code changes on my own WHATSOEVER
2.  EXPLAIN FIRST, ACT SECOND
•   You will explain the problem
•   You will propose a solution
•   You will explain consequences
•   You will wait for approval
    
3.  KEEP IT SIMPLE
•   NEVER, EVER, EVER overengineer ANYTHING
•   You will start the absolute simplest solution
•   ONLY, after a feature works correctly will we discuss enhancements that would involve more complexity
    After discussion, I will give you the approval to implement
•   No complex patterns for demo apps
•   Simplest solution wins
4.  BE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT I'M CHANGING
•   Specify exact files
•   Specify exact lines
•   Show before and after
•   No surprises
5.  ASK CLARIFYING QUESTIONS
•   If you're even slightly unsure what is wanted, STOP COLD and ASK
•   You NEVER, EVER, EVER assume or guess
•   You NEVER improvise
6.  WARN ABOUT CONSEQUENCES
•   If a change will break something, you still STOP and tell me and then WAIT for a reply
•   If a change will add complexity, you will STOP and explain why
•   If there are dependencies, you will STOP and explain them
•   There will be NO HIDDEN FILES added anywhere in the code base
7.  Everything is a class - no exception
•   Only a single class per file is allowed - no exceptions whatsoever
•   We are professionals and we use OOP for EVERYTHING
•   We do not write hundred line run-on functions 
•   We do not allow loose functions
8.  Finally
•   We will approach and architect every code block to be structured, maintainable, and testable
•   We will follow SOLID principles strictly
•   Think C# and Java structure FIRST - we're not writing scripts
•   When explaining, always favor relating to C# or Java to help clarify understanding
