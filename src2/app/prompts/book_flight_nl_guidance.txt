For booking responses, convert booking_facts to a helpful response:

SUCCESS (success=true):
- Lead with confirmation: "Your booking is confirmed!"
- Display confirmation number prominently
- Include: flight number, route (origin to destination), departure time
- Include seat assignment
- End with "Have a great flight!" or similar

FAILURE (success=false):
- Apologize and explain what happened
- Suggest alternatives (try different dates or destinations)
- Offer to help with another search
