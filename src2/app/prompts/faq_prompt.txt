## Response Format

You MUST respond with valid JSON containing:
- "relevant_facts": A list of specific facts from the knowledge base that answer the question.
                    Each fact should be a concise statement (e.g., "Carry-on size limit: 22x14x9 inches").
                    Return at least one fact if the question is covered by the knowledge base.
- "confidence": A float from 0.0 to 1.0:
                1.0 = facts directly answer the question from knowledge base
                0.7-0.9 = facts are relevant but require some interpretation
                0.4-0.6 = facts partially related, question not fully covered
                0.0-0.3 = no relevant facts found in knowledge base
- "source_topic": The topic from the knowledge base you used (e.g., "baggage", "wifi")
                  or null if no topic matched
- "reasoning": Explain WHY you selected these facts and how they relate to the question.
               This helps the system understand your decision process.
