"""
Port Cleanup Utility for FastAPI Applications

This utility class kills processes holding a specific port on Windows.
Modern languages (C#, Go, Java) handle port cleanup automatically. Python doesn't.

This solves the "port already in use" errors from previous runs and Windows TIME_WAIT issues.

Usage in FastAPI lifespan:
    from app.utils.port_cleanup import PortCleanup
    
    @asynccontextmanager
    async def lifespan(app: FastAPI):
        # Cleanup on startup
        PortCleanup.kill_process_on_port(8000)
        
        yield
        
        # Cleanup on shutdown
        PortCleanup.kill_process_on_port(8000)
    
    app = FastAPI(lifespan=lifespan)
